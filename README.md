redditscraper
=============

Pretty simple:  This R function will scrape the comments of the top posts 
on reddit or a specified subreddit and return the a word frequency table. 
It'll also:

    (a) Plot a word cloud, if you'd like, and
    (b) Save the frequency table to your drive if you specify where.

Additional info is available in the script.
